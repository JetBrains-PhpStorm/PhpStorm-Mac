## 🧩 Overview  

**PhpStorm for macOS** delivers a powerful, streamlined development experience tailored for professional PHP and web developers. Developed by **JetBrains**, this intelligent IDE merges code editing, debugging, and deployment into a single, cohesive workspace optimized for macOS performance.  

PhpStorm understands your code like no other editor — it provides deep code analysis, real-time error detection, and automated refactoring tools that make writing PHP faster and safer. With built-in support for frameworks such as **Laravel**, **WordPress**, **Symfony**, and **Yii**, plus frontend stacks like **Vue**, **React**, and **TypeScript**, it’s the perfect tool for full-stack developers.  

Integration with **Git**, **Docker**, **Composer**, and **Xdebug** ensures a seamless workflow from local development to production deployment. The live debugger, terminal access, and REST client make testing and iteration efficient and intuitive.  

Built natively for macOS, PhpStorm takes advantage of **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)** processors for ultra-fast performance and smooth project handling. Whether you’re maintaining enterprise applications or building modern APIs, PhpStorm provides the precision and efficiency developers rely on every day.
